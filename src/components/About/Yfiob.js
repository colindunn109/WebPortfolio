        YFIOB is a non-profit organization based in Santa Cruz who's goal is to present the youths of Santa Cruz with an easy
        to use interface to connect them with local work oppurtunities. I was the sole PHP backend developer, and only worked with
         another developer to help with styling our site. During my tenure, I developed administrative tools to allow our chief
         of operations to communicate with the companies and users we interacted with day to day. In addition, I handled database
         managment of our SQL server and how that data was reflected on our site, as well as javascript functionalities for
         user interaction.
